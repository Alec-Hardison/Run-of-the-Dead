    <h1>RUN OF THE DEAD </h1>
        <body>
            <p> welcome to run of the dead. That text based game where you must survive for as long as you can during the 
            zombie apocolypse. Sound fun?....Great! let's get started then. First thing you'll need is a character, we use a point by system here so yeah. Have fun with that. You'll choose between making you character super strong,super fast, super smart or super stoic(dev note need to find better word for stoic)</p>
    
            Strength:<input type = "text" name = "str" id = "str" value = 10> This is how strong your character is. It determins how "heavy " of an object he can carry and how much "stuff" he can carry around with him
            <br>
            <br>
            Speed:<input type = "text" name = "spd" id = "spd" value = 10> This is how fast you character is, you can be anywhere from micheal phelps to yutle to turtle. However the faster you move the more food you consume 
            <br>
            <br>
            Intellegence:<input type = "text" name = "int" id = "int" value = 10> In basics how smart you are, increasing you intellegence allows you to increase the amount of options you have and can increase the speed of some tasks
            <br>
            <br>
            Fortitude:<input type = "text" name = "fort" id = "fort" value = 10> This is very simple, how hard of a hit can you take?
            <br>
